The first thing to know about a Rubik‘s cube is how it structured a Rubik‘s cube has six faces each with a centerpiece. These centerpieces are locked in place and can only rotate clockwise or counterclockwise, but the white will always be opposite the yellow the red always opposite the orange and the green always opposite the blue when you rotate a cube the only things that are changing are the edges and corner pieces that are connected to the edge to the centerpiece of the face you rotating so every time you rotate a face, you move all of the pieces that are connected to it around it Such that they are now connected to a different face. There are 12 edge pieces that each have two colors so there is a white and blue edge piece a green and white edge piece in orange and white edge piece a red and white edge piece but there’s no white and yellow edge piece because white and yellow on opposite side of the cube, the same as true for all other color pairings The corner pieces have three colors each corresponding to the three edges or faces that they are connected to in its soft state, so there is a white red and blue corner piece and the same is true of all three colored pears, except for the inverses of each of the face colors so there’s going to be a white green and red white orange and green white orange and blue and white blue and red but there’s not going to be any combination of three colors, including white and yellow because they’re opposite each other. It’s important to know that the stickers of the cube do not move independently of their pieces so a corner piece is always gonna have the same three colors. The only thing that’ll change is it’s location around the cube and it’s orientation. In order to solve the cube the first thing we have to do is find the white edge pieces the white edge pieces are again going to be white green, white blue white, red and white orange so locate one of those two pieces and then you want to get it to the bottom of the cube if the white is on the top and then oriented, depending on if The white part of the edge piece is on the bottom of the cube if that is the case you want to rotate the bottom until the colored part of the white color edge piece is connected to the colored center and it matches in which case you’re going to rotate that face until the edge piece is between the white center and the color center, so you will rotate the face twice and then if the White part of the white color edge piece when it’s on the bottom layer is not facing the bottom that is, it’s facing one of the sides or you yourself then you’re going to rotate the bottom until if the color is like white green will rotate it until we are next to the green face so we would either be with the white connected to the orange or the red and then we’re going to rotate, whichever face were connected to so that the green connects the green in this case if we are on the orange, we’re going to rotate the orange face the green escape to the green, then we’re gonna connect the white to the white by rotating the green face and then make sure we revert the orange back to its original orientation so we don’t mess up any potentially already solved edges. We repeat this process for all four edges if a piece is in the middle layer or the top layer simply rotate the face until it’s on the bottom layer, move it away and then rotate the face back to not mess up anything else and then we start from the bottom layer with the edge piece we want then once we have the white cross solve with all four edges we want to find the corner pieces that are white and two other colors once you find a piece that’s white and two other colors say yourself with the two other colors are For example if you have the white green and red piece, we want to put that on the corner that is below the green and red sides and below the white side too so in other words, the slot that we want that piece to go into at the end of the day, we want to be right beneath it and then we’re going to do the following sequence of moves we’re gonna turn Looking at the colored face with the white on top and our gold piece on the bottom right corner and the destination on the top right corner we’re gonna do the moves right face counterclockwise. You also think of that is taking a down move and then the bottom face counterclockwise or a left move just realistically and then Right clockwise down clockwise and then you repeat those form of sequences until the piece is correctly oriented in the top with the white connected to the white and the colors connected to the colors and then you do that for all four so put the piece in the correct position and then Down right up left down right up left down right up left until the pieces in the proper spot and downright up left can also be said like right counterclockwise down, counterclockwise, right clockwise down, clockwise and repeat that sequence so for example, if we go right clockwise down counterclockwise right clockwise down clockwise right counterclockwise down, counterclockwise right clockwise down clockwise right clockwise down, counterclockwise right clockwise down clockwise right counterclockwise down, counterclockwise right clockwise Down clockwise right counterclockwise down counterclockwise right clockwise down clockwise we have successfully solved the white cube
