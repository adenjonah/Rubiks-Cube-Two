For example, \"U\" means turn the top face clockwise.<br><br><strong>Important note about direction:</strong> \"Clockwise\" and \"counterclockwise\" are always determined from the perspective of looking directly at the face being turned. This means that if you were to turn the cube around and look at the back face, a B (back clockwise) move would appear to be going in the opposite physical direction as an F (front clockwise) move. Think of it as if you were standing in front of each face you're about to turn.<br><br>If a letter is followed by an apostrophe ('), it means to turn that face 90 degrees counterclockwise (again, when looking directly at that face). For example, \"R'\" means turn the right face counterclockwise.<br><br>If a letter is followed by the number 2, it means to turn that face 180 degrees (a half-turn). For example, \"F2\" means turn the front face 180 degrees."

Usually, we hold the cube with the white face on top and the red face in front when starting to solve.<br><br>As you progress in your Rubik's Cube journey, you'll become more familiar with these notations and will be able to read and execute algorithms fluently."
